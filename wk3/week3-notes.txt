# Week 3
Overview
1. Objective:
- Passive and Active sniffing
- Address Resolution protocol (ARP)
- ARP poisoning
- Media Access Control (MAC) address flooding
2. Main Teaching Points
- Listening/Monitoring/Observation is intermediate step
- Exploition


Notes:
1. Network Sniffing: Process of monitoring and capturing data (packets) of a network
	+ Promiscuous mode
		+ Allows device to intercept and read each network packet that arrives in its
		 entirety
2. TCP has a sequence number to help you rearrange the packet after getting sent
3. Comparison:
	+ Char Room VS Istant Messenger
4. Significance / Risks
	+ Can see all traffic event if it was no intended for your network

- How Network sniffing Works
- Sniffer tools turns the Network Interface Card (NIC) of system to the promiscuous mode
- Attacker forces switch to behave as a hub
- Attacker PC running NIc card in Promiscuous mode
- What is ARP
